# Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Python

## Pre-work

This is the mandatory pre-work for Code 401: Python that counts as 5 full coding assignments (effectively a week's worth of work).
When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this prework and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it.
Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and not get overwhelmed.

### Operating systems
- Mac and Linux (preferably Ubuntu) are preferrable. 
- If you are using a Windows machine, figure out a way to safely partition your computer and boot a good Linux distribution like Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04
    - In the event that you are completely unable to install Linux, Windows computers are **absolutely required** to have the latest version of Windows 10
    - It is also **absolutely required** that you have installed Ubuntu Bash as a shell replacement for Windows. For more information on this please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/michaeltreat/Windows-Subsystem-For-Linux-Setup) on how to set up the Bash shell on Windows

### Set Up
1. Setup your computer with Terminal, Git, GitHub, and Slack
    - [Download Slack](https://slack.com/downloads)
2. Verify that you have Homebrew installed on your computer (if you have a Mac). If you're on Linux, you'll do similar stuff with `apt-get`. **Ensure that you have root access on your Linux machine.**
    - [Download and Install Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
3. Verify that you have Python versions 2.7 and 3.6 installed on your computer. 
    - To check if you have Python at all, type `which python`. If you have it, your terminal will return something like `/usr/local/bin/python`.
    - To check which version(s) of Python you have, type `python --version` and `python3 --version`.
4. Ensure that you have Python `pip` for both 2.7 and 3+. 
    - In a terminal window type `which pip` and `which pip3`. If you've got pip, your terminal should output text like this (but not identical to it) `/usr/local/bin/pip`
    - [Download and install here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) if you don't get anything back.

### Active Assignments

Having a level of comfort with the basic skills youâ€™ll be using every day is vital to starting your journey in Python as well as your continued success.

The additional materials below are a requirement for beginning the Code-401 Python course. You will be severly hindered if you're unable to complete the work before the course begins, so ensure that you provide yourself with at least one week. The longer you have for practice, the better!
